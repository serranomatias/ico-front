# Initial Coin Offering

I build a ICO where you can buy our Crypto Devs Token.

ICO Dapp: https://ico-front-bice.vercel.app/

### CryptoDevsToken:
- Contract Address: 0x6a82A4767628084c3a7841c97BD4cdc1e356c313
- SmartContract: https://github.com/serranomatias/hardhat-contracts-ICO

If you have a CryptoDevsNFT the can claim 10 tokens per each.

### CryptoDevsNFT:
- Contract Address: 0x1Ef9469e9A5378f471aaf20AA572e43F5835AC52
- SmartContract: https://github.com/serranomatias/hardhat-contracts

If you haven't a NFT you can mint tokens at a fixed price of 0.001 ETH.
If you are the Owner of the contract, using OnlyOwner you will be able to Withdraw the funds of the contract.

This is deployed on Goerli testnet.
